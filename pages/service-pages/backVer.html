          <h1>BACKGROUND VERIFICATION</h1>
          <p class="p-content">
            Fudged CVs are common in today's corporate world, making it a
            challenge for hiring managers to ascertain the identity claims of
            the candidate being recruited. Whether their CV is authentic their
            qualifications, work experiences and correspondence address stated
            are true that they are not a spy sent by a competitor to steal
            sensitive company information, etc. The risks of hiring without
            proper background verification are too high for an organization, but
            are often ignored. India is on the economic boom and millions of
            dollars of business is outsourced to India. The companies are in
            tremendous pressure to hire in big numbers, due to this pressure
            many unsuccessful hires arise simultaneously and the HR managers
            spend a lot of their valuable time dealing with the repercussions of
            these unsuccessful hires. A solution to the above mentioned problem
            leads to the need for Employee Background Screening at Adamma.
