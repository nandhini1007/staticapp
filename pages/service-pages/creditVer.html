          <h1>CREDIT VERIFICATION</h1>
          <p class="p-content">
            Technology has made it very easy for phony applicants to provide
            fake documents for loan applications, thus the need for Banks to
            engage external agencies with forensic skills (like Field
            Investigation Agencies, Risk Containment Units or Background
            Verification Companies) has arised.<br /><br />
            Although banks have access to Credit Information Bureau (India)
            database (i.e., Cibil database) it is limited to existing borrowers
            only, whereas field investigative agencies or background
            verification companies have been in this business for long and have
            much more to offer. Their professional expertise helps banks
            differentiate between genuine customers and fraudsters at the stage
            of data verification itself.
