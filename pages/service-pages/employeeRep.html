                  Let's be honest. Providing verifications of employment or
                  income to Banks, Telecom Companies, Prospective Employers,
                  Background Screening Companies, Insurance Companies that
                  inquires on behalf of your employees is a Productivity Killer.
                  Especially in large organizations. According to industry
                  research, your Human Resources staff will spend up to 5% of
                  their time manually providing verification information for
                  employees.<br />
